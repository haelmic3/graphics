<h1>Implementation updates</h1>
<h2>18 April 2018</h2>
<p>I started the week with fixing the lighting a bit... all I did was make the point light move-able from the javascript</p>
<p>I added a button for orthographic or perspective viewing</p>
<p>I begain writing a prototype for generating a scene.</p>
<h2>11 April 2018</h2>
<p>I started working on lighting.
I failed on many accounts.</p>
<p>I started the week playing with coloring the cube.
I ended up scraping most of that work although it can be found in the <a href="../0.1.1/">0.1.1 archive</a>. I underestimated the amoutnt of work lighting would be and I bairly produced anything that is worth keeping.</p>
<p>There's a chance I might just start over. But if I can salvage something I will. The main other plan this week was to set up point manipulation.
I have this idea for how I want to do it but I failed to make any progress toward that plan.</p>
<p>A frustrating week.</p>
<h2>4 April 2018</h2>
<p>I start working on 3d graphics.
At the beginning of the week I was still working from the Mozilla tutorial.
I got a 3d vertex buffer set up and I open it up.
Instead of seeing the cube as a solid projection it shows up as vertex points.
They transform so I know that I have everything right.
I spend the entire week going line by line trying to figure out why wont draw.
I wake up Tuesday and decide to work on it after pulling my hair out the day before.
I watch a lecture on the tutorial. Tried shrinking the cube, which only shrunk the cube.
I knew there was a spelling error some where. I had told my self it was the case.
I find there are different enumerated types for drawing. I try a different one.
It worked. I had spelled TRIANGLES wrong.
I spent today getting the project ready to move into dynamic buffers. For user modeling. 
</p>
<h2>28 March 2018</h2>
<p>I started the project by setting up the page layout.
I then needed to learn WebGL so started following a Mozilla tutorial.
I got to render a 2d square in WebGL and at that point I was out of time..
